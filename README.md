# Trie-Based Autocomplete System with Large Dataset

This project implements an autocomplete system using a Trie (prefix tree) data structure. It efficiently provides word suggestions based on a given prefix and is tested with a large dataset of English words from the NLTK corpus.

## Features

1. **Efficient Word Insertion**: Insert words into the Trie with frequency tracking.
2. **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Retrieve word suggestions based on a prefix, sorted by frequency.
3. **Large Dataset Support**: Uses a large list of English words from the NLTK corpus for testing.

## Requirements

The project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries:

- `collections` (part of Python's standard library)
- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install the `nltk` library using:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

## Usage

### 1. Insert Words into the Trie

Words are inserted into the Trie, and their frequencies are tracked. The TrieNode structure uses `defaultdict` for efficient memory management.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = defaultdict(TrieNode)
        self.is_end_of_word = False
        self.frequency = 0  # Frequency of the word ending here

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True
        node.frequency += 1  # Increment frequency every time the word is inserted
```

### 2. Autocomplete Suggestions

Retrieve autocomplete suggestions for a given prefix. Suggestions are sorted by frequency in descending order.

```python
def autocomplete(self, prefix: str, max_suggestions=10):
    node = self.search_prefix(prefix)
    if not node:
        return []

    suggestions = []
    self._find_words(node, prefix, suggestions)
    suggestions.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [word for word, freq in suggestions[:max_suggestions]]

def _find_words(self, node, prefix, suggestions):
    if node.is_end_of_word:
        suggestions.append((prefix, node.frequency))
    for char, child_node in node.children.items():
        self._find_words(child_node, prefix + char, suggestions)
```

### 3. Using NLTK Corpus

The `nltk` library is used to obtain a large list of English words for testing the autocomplete system.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('words')

from nltk.corpus import words

# Initialize trie and insert words from the nltk corpus
trie = Trie()
word_list = words.words()  # Get large list of English words

for word in word_list:
    trie.insert(word.lower())  # Insert each word into the Trie

# Test autocomplete with a large dataset
prefix = "soci"
suggestions = trie.autocomplete(prefix, max_suggestions=10)

print(f"Autocomplete suggestions for '{prefix}': {suggestions}")
```

### Example Output

For the prefix `"soci"`, the autocomplete suggestions might include:

```bash
Autocomplete suggestions for 'soci': ['social', 'society', 'sociable', ...]
```

## How It Works

### Trie Structure

The Trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character in a word. Words are stored as paths from the root node to leaf nodes. Each `TrieNode` contains:
- `children`: A `defaultdict` of child nodes.
- `is_end_of_word`: A boolean flag indicating the end of a valid word.
- `frequency`: The frequency of the word if this node marks the end of a word.

### Autocomplete Functionality

The `autocomplete` function retrieves suggestions based on a given prefix. It traverses the Trie to find all words that start with the prefix, sorts them by frequency, and returns the top suggestions.

### Large Dataset Testing

The system is tested with a large dataset of English words obtained from the NLTK corpus, demonstrating its capability to handle substantial word lists efficiently.

## Extending the Code

You can extend this project by:
- **Adding More Words**: Incorporate additional datasets or word lists.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Implement more efficient algorithms or data structures.
- **Supporting Other Languages**: Adapt the Trie for multilingual support.
